// because many times skynet libraries need to pass errors over postMessage,

// errTuple is a type that pairs a 'data' field with an 'err' field. Skynet
// libraries typically prefer returning errTuples to throwing or rejecting,
// because it allows upstream code to avoid the try/catch/throw pattern. Though
// the pattern is much celebrated in javascript, it encourages relaxed error
// handling, and often makes error handling much more difficult because the try
// and the catch are in different scopes.
//
// Most of the Skynet core libraries do not have any `throws` anywhere in their
// API.
//
// Typically, an errTuple will have only one field filled out. If data is
// returned, the err should be 'null'. If an error is returned, the data field
// should generally be empty. Callers are expected to check the error before
// they access any part of the data field.

// Stage 3: kernel is loaded, user is logged in
// Stage 4: kernel is loaded, user is logging out (refresh iminent)
//
// 'kernelLoaded' is initially set to "not yet" and will be updated when the
// kernel has loaded. If it is set to "success", it means the kernel loaded
// without issues. If it is set to anything else, it means that there was an
// error, and the new value is the error.
//
// 'kernelLoaded' will not be changed until 'loginComplete' has been set to
// true. 'loginComplete' can be set to true immediately if the user is already
// logged in.
//
// 'logoutComplete' can be set to 'true' at any point, which indicates that the
// auth cycle needs to reset.
