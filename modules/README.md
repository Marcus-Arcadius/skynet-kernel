# Kernel Modules

This is a collection of modules that are important to kernel development. Some
of them are testing modules, and some of them are core libraries that are
expected to be key dependencies of most applications.

If you are interested in attempting kernel development yourself, we recommend
checking out the 'template' module, which contains some basic module code and
some instructions for getting started with module development.
