		<p> This is an example extension where the redirect is working.
		The main challenge with this extension is that the URL bar
		changes, which makes the security model a lot more fragile, we
		want to associate all of the activity in the browser with
		kernel.siasky.net and home.siasky.net. I've chosen to keep the
		example extension around so if we figure out other ways to
		approach the kernel in the future, we know how to do redirects.
		It should save a few hundred milliseconds in loading time if
		the page is not cached.
